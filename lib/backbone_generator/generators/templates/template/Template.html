<h1>Aloha! fellow javascripters</h1>

<p>This app was generated with the <code>backbone_generator</code> gem</p>
<p>This view was dynamically inserted into the DOM using the awesomeness of
<code>backbone.js</code></p> I think its really cool that you are writting 
javascript code that is maintainable. This view is located in <code>js/templates/Hello.Template.html</code>

<h2>Getting started</h2>
